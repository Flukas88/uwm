USELESS Window Manager Experiments
==================================

Actually This is not a window manager :) . Hopefully one day it will be a minimalistic window manager.

It contains just experiments on xlib development. 

Actually you can find experiments on:
1. Basic event handling
2. Basic keyboard handling
3. Window creation
4. Setting color background
5. Showing Text
